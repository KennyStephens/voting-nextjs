This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

Questions:

Three phases to get data:

1. Build Time
   - getStaticProps
   - getStaticPaths (used for dynamic routes)
2. Server-side rendered
   - getServerSideProps
   - When would I use this? When the page must be blocked until the data is fetched? But still needed for SEO?
3. Client-side
   - SWR - https://swr.vercel.app/ async requets
   - Use when the page can load without the data and SEO is not a problem?

TODO:

- Add information about how this avoids shady gambling sponsors?
- Change blog post to have image showing
- Continue blog posts
- Data vizualization for money given to valve and how much goes to teams
- Create script to auto close polls that are past
- Limit polls and lazy load after 5 or 10
- Allow one poll to have its own page?

Emails:

- Create email template for newsletter (include unsubscribe link)
- Create an email template for a poll closing soon? Maybe not...

Blog ideas:

(Make sure to internally link to different pages)

- Copy data from google docs about why people should make mores
- Updates on where the DPC is
- Find player tweets/org tweets about not enough money in the DPC and talk about them and how we solve the problem
- Case studies on performance of people playing a game more hours and getting better at it
- Explain the logic behind why we should pay more money to players and less to valve
- Talk about when a team had to forfeit because players had jobs to do (bounty hunter team?)
